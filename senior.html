        <p>The senior experience is a special session that I have created to celebrate our 2020 seniors.
            They have missed out on so many senior activities and ended their senior year in a way no one would have imagined.
            With that in mind, I wanted to offer something that allows you to spend an evening loving on your senior.</p>
            <br>
        <p>The senior experience is $250</p>
            <br>
        <p>The Senior Experience Includes:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>60-90 minute session</li>
            <li>30 fully edited digital images</li>
